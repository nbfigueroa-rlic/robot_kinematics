# robot_kinematics

This package generates a class-structure of the kinematic chain of any robot arm given its DH (Denavit-Hartenberg) parameters. With this structure you can compute the following:
- Forward kinematics
- Jacobian

The class is implemented in both `c++` and `python`, can be used in real-time. We provide usage examples with: (i) thea 7-DOF arm of an iCub humanoid robot, (ii) a 7-DOF Kuka LWR-4+, (iii) a 6-DOF Kuka LWR-4+ and (iv) the 6-DOF M**** C***.

- **Note:** The code in this package was forkef from [robot-kinematics](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/robot-kinematics) and [Robot-kinematic](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/Robot-kinematic)
